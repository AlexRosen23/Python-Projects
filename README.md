Hello, my name is Alex Rosen. I am a student at the Luddy School of Informatics,
Computing, and Engineering at Indiana University. In this folder, you 
will find a collection of Python files containing a series of 
concise and straightforward programs. Each file demonstrates 
different aspects of programming that I've explored during my studies. 
Please feel free to explore these examples.
